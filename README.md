# 🦞 Ultra Lobster
A theme for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

![UltraLobster](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87339163/218859194-f572490d-a047-445f-b47d-e793ec4052ab.png)

Ultra Lobster is a living interface theme for Obsidian, heavily inspired by modern design and focused on color and type. At its core, it is a series of soft resets to bring the base inline with trendy modern applications like Notion, the G-Suite, Discord, and minimal editors such as Bear.

Careful changes were made to bring modern design trends, but not deviate too far from the ‘vanilla structure’ we know and love. To do so, I often compared the two interfaces side by side to make sure I remained on track.

## 🎨 Color Choices
Ultra Lobster offers, with Style Settings, a growing selection of carefully crafted & curated color palettes that balance aesthetics with readability. Many popular palettes are included, with many more planned for update 2. Alongside classic palettes, several custom swatches of  handpicked or generated colors are available for both light and dark modes.

Lobster Time is my own WIP palette, inspired by low contrast desert tones and faded memories. The light mode is reminiscent of manilla envelopes, while the dark mode breaks from the common red and blue hues of many dark UI themes, instead opting for a green accent and coloring. Both modes offer high contrast for easy reading, while still maintaining an aesthetically pleasing look.

## ⌨️ Type Choices 
Ultra Lobster places a strong emphasis on typography, with a focus on increasing readability and reducing strain on the eyes. To achieve this, I spent hours researching and fine-tuning font pairs and CSS settings based on factors such as contrast, legibility, and spacing. I chose to use a serif font for titles and a sans serif font for UI and text elements, as this follows centuries of design tradition and has been shown to have benefits for readability in older populations. 

The specific fonts used are:
- DT Nightingale or Getai for titles
- Syne for headers (coming soon)
- Aspekta or Uncut Sans for UI & editor text
- Evil Martian for monospace

In order to save on file size, I primarily used variable fonts and only included as many as were necessary. Update 3 of Ultra Lobster is planned to expand typeface options, and offer an option snippet of font imports.

## ⬇️ Installation

Ultra Lobster can be found within the Obsidian community theme hub! Navigate to: 

Settings ⇨ Appearance ⇨ Themes and click “**Manage**” and search for `Ultra Lobster`

### ⚙️ Configuration

Ultra Lobster is designed to be an extensible theme, and I plan to offer a variety of customization options in the future.

For now, there are numerous optional toggles and experimental features offered via the **[Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) plugin**. These options include color palettes, font options, background gradients, custom theme-corrected accent colors, note radius, border options, many minimal feature opt-ins, and canvas controllers for each color. 

In a future pass I hope to both further expand the offerings, and streamline their presentation.
