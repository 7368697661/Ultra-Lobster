# Ultra Lobster

_Ultra Lobster_ is my own take on 'rounding out the corners' of Obsidian's default theme. The project started as an attempt to reduce visual clutter, while not simply removing information. I also wanted to take a chance to create an intuitive environment that built upon a 'tactile' canvas... I wanted cards, ok. With rounded corners, especially.

üé® Colors and fonts were handpicked over the course of months to finally arrive at a combination of values that both enhances vanilla Obsidian, and helps you focus on what matters: the words.

Various components have been tweaked and modified to bring in line with this design spec. I chose to keep the prompt dark across modes, to give a clear visual field. While I use replacements for the stock prompts, careful consideration has been taken to ensure a standard experience.

_The Command Pallete_

üë©‚Äçüíª Additionally, [Better Command Palette](https://github.com/AlexBieg/obsidian-better-command-palette) and [Omnisearch](https://github.com/scambier/obsidian-omnisearch) have also been themed to match the base prompts.

I tried to make links more subtle, with an accent line for (un)resolved internal links. Tags, inline code, highlights and many other aspects of the UI have been changed to bring them all inline with each other, and other aspects of the theme. Finally, font settings have been meticulously tweaked to provide the optimal trade-off between use of white space and clean design.
