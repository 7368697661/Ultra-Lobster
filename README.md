# 📝 intro
ultra lobster, a~~n intentional~~ writing experience.

![light2](https://github.com/7368697661/Ultra-Lobster/assets/87339163/6c9ff476-54e5-4172-b6ea-90c3e967b1a9)

i started working on ultra lobster for two reasons: 
- one, was that no themes currently on the market fit my _exact_ needs. 
- two, i wanted to push obsidian as far as possible.`*`
`*` namely by changing the ui to a card layout that is currently trending.

that being said, ‘ultra lobster: unity’ is the culmination of all the css i have written for obsidian. i tried to include all the snippets, options, and even themes i have been working on over the past year. the result is a rather large theme that should offer plenty of options without being too overwhelming. because at the end of the day, i simply want to make a theme that makes taking notes more pleasant.

## ⚒ styling changes

### 🃏 card ui

the base ultra lobster ui features a card with subtle border and shadow (both toggleable via style settings). additionally, most borders have been disabled or altered. finally, each workspace leaf and the workspace background have faint gradients applied as backgrounds to add polish.

### 📁 file explorer

![image](https://github.com/7368697661/Ultra-Lobster/assets/87339163/8c1f6aed-dbc0-40ac-a3e7-20bdf13cf798)

the file explorer features small changes to items and highlights. i didn’t like the way obsidian showed the highlighted file as taking up the entire line. taking up the line lead to overlapping the indentation line on the left side, and i felt that some small changes would make it more seamless. it’s not a perfect solution, but works well enough for my liking.

### 🗣 blockquotes

![image](https://github.com/7368697661/Ultra-Lobster/assets/87339163/c6659f55-b9f8-4ecd-a9ba-d7efff2c001a)

blockquotes have been stripped of styling in live view, and feature a shadow and border in reading view. they also support the citation syntax from eleanor konik’s wonderful palatinate theme.

### ❗ callouts

for callouts, i kept it simple for defaults. however, with style settings, i offer a view different versions:
- gummy | the callouts from my gummy theme

### 🖼 canvas

gods… so much here. there are, idk, like over 2k`*` lines of just canvas stuff. there are multiple options per card, from several themes & snippets; along with the option to disable borders per card.
`*` citation needed.

### 🖥 codeblocks
code blocks, by default are very minimal in both live edit and reading mode. they have slight animations, and a small gradient. additionally, with style settings, there are multiple alternative options:
- gummy | codeblocks from my gummy theme with accent colors and dynamic glow (only in reading mode).
	- ![image](https://github.com/7368697661/Ultra-Lobster/assets/87339163/ff0fd5d8-511d-442f-bbfc-87f30598a026)
- notosx | terminal windows style blocks by zamsyt#4459 💖 (only works in live preview mode).

### Ⓜ menus & prompts

![image](https://github.com/7368697661/Ultra-Lobster/assets/87339163/5cebacdf-3f48-4509-8b98-92b900b5ecf6)

menus, prompts, tooltips, notices, and modals have all been redone with altered borders, shadows, and gradients.

### ⚙ alt-themes
the name “ultra lobster: unity” comes from the fact that i have combined origami, gummy, and all of my working edits`*` into one theme. 

it is, effectively, three themes in a trench-coat.
`*` we 1-2 are still wip.

### 🎨 color schemes

![light](https://github.com/7368697661/Ultra-Lobster/assets/87339163/d99611d4-eb32-4ab8-bc8b-020952dc72ba)
![dark](https://github.com/7368697661/Ultra-Lobster/assets/87339163/53ce1e25-628f-4697-8df4-9c60a62b684f)

there are many themes, both for light and dark mode, that can be selected separately. there are also several dark-mode-only themes. there are quite a few options, from popular schemes to collabs and many of my own design. below you can see a library of previews:

### ⌨ type options
ultra lobster offeres a fairly wide range of font options with style settings. serifs, sans-serifs, and monospace all have options, along with titles and headers. headers also have several options.

## ❓ is this theme missing something?
open a ticket! I can't promise I will always be the fastest, but i'll try to add support and push fixes as quickly as I can.
