I love the Obsidian UI, but have a few tweaks I use personally. I am an indie front end dev, so this has been a learning oportunity! This isn't a "minimal" theme, per say, although I do remove and reduce many elements; rather, it is a theme that attempts to build up a tactile work enviroment for focus and deep work.

For now, this theme features a fully themed light and dark mode, with a focus on readability and contrast. I have spent weeks researching contrast and color schemes in an effort to create a writing enviroment that I love to work in; along the way I leaned on my background in design to build a user experiance helps you focus more on the words that matter.

I personally use Omnisearch and Better Command Palette (_with Doubleshift!_), so I have adapted both (along with the vanilla prompts) to offer a pro palette to increase visibility. Influx and Kanban boards also have support for color styling.
